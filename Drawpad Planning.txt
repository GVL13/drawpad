Drawpad Planning:

-Make a text box asking for a number input (creates "x") and a button to submit
-Make a JS function that takes a # as input "x"
-Use JQ to create the function, which makes a square grid of x boxes
-Box width/height is calculated as (width/height of page in px)/(sq root of x)
-Each box gets a hover function
